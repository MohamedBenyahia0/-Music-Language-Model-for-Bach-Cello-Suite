# -Music-Language-Model-for-Bach-Cello-Suite
Developed a neural network language model to learn the musical structure of Johann Sebastian Bach's Cello Suites using symbolic MIDI file representations, encoding musical notes, durations, and intensities. Trained the model on the full set of Bach's Cello Suites to generate original, computer-composed MIDI sequences inspired by Bachâ€™s style.
